## 虚构造函数

<!-- Virtual destructors -->

<!-- Although C++ provides a default destructor for your classes if you do not provide one yourself, it is sometimes the case that you will want to provide your own destructor (particularly if the class needs to deallocate memory). You should always make your destructors virtual if you’re dealing with inheritance. Consider the following example: -->

尽管C++会在你不提供结构函数时默认提供一个，但是你有时要体用自己的结构函数（尤其是需要分配内存的类）。你应该总是将析构函数，设置为虚函数，在处理集成关系的时候。考虑下面的例子：

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class Base
{
public:
    ~Base() // note: not virtual
    {
        std::cout << "Calling ~Base()\n";
    }
};
 
class Derived: public Base
{
private:
    int* m_array;
 
public:
    Derived(int length)
      : m_array{ new int[length] }
    {
    }
 
    ~Derived() // note: not virtual (your compiler may warn you about this)
    {
        std::cout << "Calling ~Derived()\n";
        delete[] m_array;
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    Derived *derived { new Derived(5) };
    Base *base { derived };
 
    delete base;
 
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- Note: If you compile the above example, your compiler may warn you about the non-virtual destructor (which is intentional for this example). You may need to disable the compiler flag that treats warnings as errors to proceed. -->

注意：如果你编译了上面的例子，你的编译器可能提示你有关非虚解构函数（故意在例子中呈现的）。你也可以禁用编译器的 flag，这样可以将 warnings 视为报错来执行。

<!-- Because base is a Base pointer, when base is deleted, the program looks to see if the Base destructor is virtual. It’s not, so it assumes it only needs to call the Base destructor. We can see this in the fact that the above example prints: -->

因为 base 是一个 `Base` 指针，当 `base` 被删除的时候，程序检查 `Base` 解构函数是虚函数。而它并不是，所以它假设它只需要调用 `Base` 类的析构函数，我们听过下面的输出来了解这个：

```cpp
Calling ~Base()
```

However, we really want the delete function to call Derived’s destructor (which will call Base’s destructor in turn), otherwise m_array will not be deleted. We do this by making Base’s destructor virtual:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class Base
{
public:
    virtual ~Base() // note: virtual
    {
        std::cout << "Calling ~Base()\n";
    }
};
 
class Derived: public Base
{
private:
    int* m_array;
 
public:
    Derived(int length)
      : m_array{ new int[length] }
    {
    }
 
    virtual ~Derived() // note: virtual
    {
        std::cout << "Calling ~Derived()\n";
        delete[] m_array;
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    Derived *derived { new Derived(5) };
    Base *base { derived };
 
    delete base;
 
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- Now this program produces the following result: -->
这个程序产生下列效果：

```cpp
Calling ~Derived()
Calling ~Base()
```

<!-- Rule: Whenever you are dealing with inheritance, you should make any explicit destructors virtual. -->
规则：无论你何时处理继承，你应该显式的设置析构函数为虚函数

<!-- As with normal virtual member functions, if a base class function is virtual, all derived overrides will be considered virtual regardless of whether they are specified as such. It is not necessary to create an empty derived class destructor just to mark it as virtual. -->

与普通虚函数成员一样，如果一个基类函数是虚函数，所有的继承重写类将会被当做虚函数，无论你是否指定。如果派生类的解构函数不为空，就请标注为虚函数。

## 虚赋值方法
<!-- Virtual assignment -->

可以将赋值操作符设为虚函值，不像析构函数那样，设置为虚构函数总是一个好主意，将赋值操作符设置为虚拟化就容易引起很多bug，并且进入在这个教程之外的话题。因此，为了简单起见，我们建议你目前先让虚函数为非虚函数。
<!-- It is possible to make the assignment operator virtual. However, unlike the destructor case where virtualization is always a good idea, virtualizing the assignment operator really opens up a bag full of worms and gets into some advanced topics outside of the scope of this tutorial. Consequently, we are going to recommend you leave your assignments non-virtual for now, in the interest of simplicity. -->

<!-- Ignoring virtualization -->
## 忽略虚函数

<!-- Very rarely you may want to ignore the virtualization of a function. For example, consider the following code: -->
有时候你想要忽略一个函数的虚化，例如，看看下面的代码：

```cpp
class Base
{
public:
    virtual const char* getName() const { return "Base"; }
};
 
class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    virtual const char* getName() const { return "Derived"; }
};
```

在这个例子中，你也许想要使用指向派生类的基类指针调用 `Base::getName()` 而不是 `Derived::getName()`。为了这样，只需要简单的使用范围解析操作符：

<!-- There may be cases where you want a Base pointer to a Derived object to call Base::getName() instead of c. To do so, simply use the scope resolution operator: -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    Derived derived;
    const Base &base { derived };
    // Calls Base::GetName() instead of the virtualized Derived::GetName()
    std::cout << base.Base::getName() << '\n';
 
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- You probably won’t use this very often, but it’s good to know it’s at least possible. -->

你也许不会经常这样使用，但知道也还是不错的。

<!-- Should we make all destructors virtual? -->
## 我们是否应该使所有结构函数为虚函数

<!-- This is a common question asked by new programmers. As noted in the top example, if the base class destructor isn’t marked as virtual, then the program is at risk for leaking memory if a programmer later deletes a base class pointer that is pointing to a derived object. One way to avoid this is to mark all your destructors as virtual. But should you? -->

这是一个新手常问的问题。正如上方例子所说，如果基类结构函数没有标注为虚函数，程序员稍后删除指向派生类的基类指针时程序有内存泄露的风险。一个避免的方式就是将所有析构函数标注为虚函数，但是你应该那样做么？

<!-- It’s easy to say yes, so that way you can later use any class as a base class -- but there’s a performance penalty for doing so (a virtual pointer added to every instance of your class). So you have to balance that cost, as well as your intent. -->
说”是“很容易，然后你稍后使用任何类作为一个基类 —— 但这样做存在性能代价（一个虚指针会添加到每个类的实例中）。因此你不得不平衡开销，和你的意图。

<!-- Conventional wisdom (as initially put forth by Herb Sutter, a highly regarded C++ guru) has suggested avoiding the non-virtual destructor memory leak situation as follows, “A base class destructor should be either public and virtual, or protected and nonvirtual.” A class with a protected destructor can’t be deleted via a pointer, thus preventing the accidental deleting of a derived class through a base pointer when the base class has a non-virtual destructor. Unfortunately, this also means the base class can’t be deleted through a base class pointer, which essentially means the class can’t be dynamically allocated or deleted except by a derived class. This also precludes using smart pointers (such as std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr) for such classes, which limits the usefulness of that rule (we cover smart pointers in a later chapter). It also means the base class can’t be allocated on the stack. That’s a pretty heavy set of penalties. -->

传统的智慧（最初由 Herb Sutter 提出，一个很重要的 C++ 老师）建议避免如下的集中非虚函数结构函数内存泄露情况，”一个基类结构函数应该既是public的又是虚函数，或者 是protected 且非虚函数。“，一个带有 protected 解构函数的类实例不能被通过指针来删除，因此阻止了当一基类有非虚析构函数的时候，意外的通过基类指针删除一个派生类。不幸的是，这也意味着基类不能被通过一个基类指针删除，基本上意味着类不能被动态分配，或者如期被派生类删除。这也排除了在这个类上使用智能指针（例如 `std::unique_ptr` 和 `std::shared_ptr`），限制了那个规则（我们将在之后的课程中介绍智能指针）的可用性。它也意味着基类不能被在栈上分配。那是一个相当重的代价。

<!-- Now that the final specifier has been introduced into the language, our recommendations are as follows: -->
既然 final 描述符已经被引入到这个语言，我们的建议如下：

- 如果你的类打算被继承，请确保析构函数是虚函数。
- 如果你的类不打算被继承，将你的类标注为 final，这将会阻止其他类一开始就从该类派生，但是不会对该类本身带来任何限制
    <!-- If you intend your class to be inherited from, make sure your destructor is virtual. -->
    <!-- If you do not intend your class to be inherited from, mark your class as final. This will prevent other classes from inheriting from it in the first place, without imposing any other use restrictions on the class itself. -->
